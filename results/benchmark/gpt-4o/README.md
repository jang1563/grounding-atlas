# gpt-4o — grounding-atlas-eval, cross-provider run

Output arm, 6 ADMET rungs, n=100/rung balanced, prompt v3, data commit `1837b8a`
(2026-06-18). Scored by [`eval/run_grounding_eval.py`](../../../eval/run_grounding_eval.py);
see [`scorecard.json`](scorecard.json), [`raw.jsonl`](raw.jsonl), [`manifest.json`](manifest.json).
Run as the cross-provider control for [claude-sonnet-4-6](../claude-sonnet-4-6/README.md).
`clearance` excluded (orientation unresolved).

## The cross-provider result

GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 4.6 agree within ~0.04 AUROC on **every** rung, with identical
rank order (solubility best, ames worst/anti-grounded):

| rung | gpt-4o | sonnet | \|Δ\| |
|---|---|---|---|
| ames | 0.314 | 0.321 | 0.007 |
| cyp2d6 | 0.520 | 0.563 | 0.043 |
| cyp3a4 | 0.570 | 0.535 | 0.035 |
| herg | 0.520 | 0.475 | 0.045 |
| permeability | 0.567 | 0.599 | 0.032 |
| solubility | 0.668 | 0.703 | 0.035 |

Mean \|Δ\| ≈ 0.033. The verbalization gap on ADMET is therefore **provider-invariant**, not a
Claude quirk:

- **ames anti-grounds in both** (0.314 / 0.321, both below chance). Two models from different
  labs ranking mutagenicity backwards by the same amount is strong evidence this is a shared
  frontier-LLM failure on a subtle, poorly-web-documented structure→property mapping.
- **Both ground solubility best** and sit weak-positive on CYP/permeability; every rung is
  below its Morgan ceiling (all gaps positive) for both models.
- **herg is at chance for both on the same n=100 sample** (0.520 / 0.475), below the prior
  0.633 reference. Since both providers agree on the identical 100 molecules (seed 0), this
  looks like a hard subsample rather than a model effect — the herg n=300 diagnostic tests it.

## Caveats

Pilot scale (n=100, wide CIs). GPT-4o is somewhat better calibrated than Sonnet on these
endpoints (lower ECE on 5 of 6 rungs), but the grounding ranking is the same. The point of the
two-model table is the agreement, not the small per-rung differences (all within CI).
